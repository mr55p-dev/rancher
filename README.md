# rancher

`rancher` is a utility for creating Git branches. Very simple, run `rancher`, fill out the fields,
and get a git branch at the end of it. Branches are created with the format `{feature type?}/{ticket?}/{description}`.

> [!NOTE]
> It's possible to customise the separator, but not yet the layout of the components in the branch.
> If this is a feature you really want, make an issue!
